My first SFML graphical interface project! A simple yet powerful system that displays geometric shapes with real-time calculations, plus a bonus 3D rotating cube animation.

Features
Main Application
Shape Visualization: Renders circles, rectangles, squares, triangles, and custom polygons

Mathematical Calculations: Automatically computes perimeter and surface area for all shapes

Coordinate System: Clean Cartesian coordinate display with proper scaling

Console Output: Displays detailed shape information and calculations

Multiple Shapes: Support for various geometric forms with inheritance hierarchy

Bonus Feature
3D Rotating Cube: Separate executable showcasing a wireframe cube with smooth 3D rotation

Real-time Animation: Frame-rate independent rotation using delta time
